By satiation we mean the comfortable sensation you perceive when you have eaten a meal and you have eaten enough, but not too much.’ After the first 5 min trial, the participant is given the second jug and instructed: ‘We now ask you to drink again during five minutes. Please continue drinking until your stomach is completely full, that is, entirely filled with water.’ The experimenter leaves the room for both 5-min trials Experimenter records the amount of water drank from each jug. Respiratory Resistance (RR) 10s trials 5 levels of resistance (4 filters + 1 no filter trial) each presented 1x in random order Participant cannot see which filter is being placed Order of resistance presented is randomized During this task, participants will breathe through a mask covering both the mouth and nose, connected to a two-way non-rebreathing valve (Ambu Mark III, Ambu GmbH) via a bacterial and viral filter. The inlet valve will be connected to a plastic tube to which the inspiratory load can be attached. We plan to use Hans Rudolph Linear Resistors 7100R providing a passive restriction of the inspiratory air flow by the following resistances: 0, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cmH20/liters per second (LPS). The linear resistors will be placed on the inspiratory plastic tubing for 10 s which corresponded to an average of 2 breathing cycles. After the 10s trial, participants will rate their subjective effort, unpleasantness, intensity, difficulty, stress, and fear using a VAS for each. Breath Hold (BH) Participant places nose clip on nose Instruct participant to “exhale all air out of your lungs, then take a deep breath in and then hold it as long as you can tolerate.” Participant does not exhale during breath hold The trial lasts up to 2-min and the participant exhales into the capnometer. Experimenter records: Duration of breath (seconds) PEF (L/min) FEV1 (L) Participant completes VAS ratings 2-min break between trails; two trials total Taste Task (TT) [NEED TO ADD] Von Frey Filaments (VFF) Press VFF into palm of participant hand for 10s; Participants then make VAS rating Complete each of the filaments (1x) with random order presentation (5 trials total) Participant eyes closed Visceral Interoceptive Attention (VIA; Completed during MRI) Participants will complete 3 runs of the Visceral Interoceptive Attention (VIA) Task in the MRI machine. During each run, participants will be presented with cues to different body locations (“Heart”, “Lungs”, “Uterus”, “Target” (exteroceptive condition)). They will be instructed to attend to the body location represented by the cue while the cue is on the screen. Additionally, participants will complete a simple attention check (intensity ratings) following 1/3 of trials to make sure they are still engaged in the task1. Stimuli will be presented in a fixed-random order across sessions, with each run having a different order (i.e., 3 versions of the task, each presented once per session). Additionally, each trial will have a mean ITI of 4000ms (range 2000ms – 6000ms). All components of the task will be TR-locked. ##MRI Parameters - [NEED TO ADD] 3.7 Biosamples Blood [NEED TO ADD] Stool [NEED TO ADD] 3.8 Cycle Tracking [NEED TO ADD] 3.9 Funding N/A "],["data-collection.html", "Section 4 Data Collection 4.1 Data Storage 4.2 Data Scoring", " Section 4 Data Collection 4.1 Data Storage The questionnaire data is stored in REDCap. Scripts and Processed Data is stored in Box. 4.2 Data Scoring Data Scoring R-script: [ADD LINK TO SCRIPT LATER] All Data scoring was completed in R. Mean imputation is completed for all missing values. When a sub-scale is present, the mean imputed value is based on the sub-scale questions only. Scoring Notes: ICQ All items are responded to on a scale from 1 (Does not describe me) to 5 (Describes me very well). Reverse Scored Items: 4, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19 marked with * are reverse scored (5 = 1, 4 = 2, 2 = 4, 1 = 5). An interoceptive confusion total score, ranging between 20 and 100, was calculated by summing all responses following reverse scoring (Brewer et al., 2016). CTQ A Cumulative Trauma Score is calculated for our CTQ, which is a sum of the perceived impact of the 6-traumas asked about. Reference for scoring procedure: Ju, T., Naliboff, B.
