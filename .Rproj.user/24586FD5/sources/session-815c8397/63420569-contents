Cyclic Hormones and Interoception with Repeated Profiling (CHIRP) Wiki

## Aims
**Aim 1:** To characterize if measures of interoception will vary across the menstrual cycle. We hypothesize that there will be greater variation between phases of the menstrual cycle than variation across all days. As part of this aim we will also be able to examine whether these changes are organ specific or general across interoceptive domains, and if the variation is specific or general to interoceptive vs. exteroceptive processing. 

**Aim 2:** To assess if variation in interoception across the menstrual cycle will be associated with variation in mood. We hypothesize that changes in interoception throughout the menstrual cycle will be associated with variation in mood (i.e., affect, depression, anxiety). We can also test if these associations are specific for interoception of different organs. 

**Aim 3:** To test if there are differences in interoceptive variation and/or association with mood between the control and PMDD participant. We hypothesize that the PMDD participant will show greater variation in mood and interoception. 

**Exploratory Aim:** The composition of the gut-microbiome will vary across the menstrual cycle. 


## Background

The Cyclic Hormones and Interoception with Repeated Profiling (CHIRP) study aims to characterize how measures of interoception may vary across the course of the menstrual cycle.  The study will employ a dense sampling approach with a multitude of different interoceptive measures that span both different domains (e.g., sensibility, accuracy, and insight) and organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal). We plan to follow two female participants over the course of 4 months who are naturally-cycle to assessment various measures of interoception and mood approximately every other day (52 in-person sessions total). One participant will have elevated PMDD symptoms and the other will not.

Interoception will be assessed both via self-report and task-based measures, that span several organ systems. This will include tasked-based assessments of cardiac, respiratory, and gastrointestinal interoceptive abilities, and also neural measures of interoceptive attention – including attention to uterine sensations – using fMRI. Additionally, we will collect task-based assessments of exteroceptive sensory processing including taste, touch, and visual processing. Along with the self-report measures of interoception and mood, and task based-measures of interoception, the study will also collect a variety of biological features including structural MRI, gut-microbiome samples, resting heart rate, and LH levels.  

The dense-sampling approach to this study allows for the probing of a multitude of research questions. The primary focus will be to understand if and how interoception varies across the menstrual cycle and if and how it may relate to fluctuations in mood. However, the repeated sampling of interoceptive measures across different domains and organ systems also allows for testing of more basic science questions around the reliability of different interoceptive measures and the concordance of interoceptive ability across organ systems. Clinically, this study can also provide important insight into PMDD pathology by comparing the richly sampled data between a participant with and without elevated PMDD symptoms. While the small sample size does limit generalizability, the data for this study should provide critical starting points for studies of interoception and menstrual health with me narrow focus and larger sample sizes.
